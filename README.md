# Analyzing Tweets within Sehir University

My aim in this research is to analyze the Twitter network of Istanbul Sehir Univesity using various NLP methods. First, I constructed the Sehir Tweeter Network (STN) and then, proceed to NLP analysis. The methods I utilized through the analysis are as follows (in order).

- Determine what are the most popular topics within STN using *latent dirichlet allocation*
- Construct a label prediction model to categorize tweets using *fasttext* and *basic neural networks*
- Test the coherency (performance) of our prediction model using *LSTM networks*
- Assign a label to each tweet then, analyze the distribution of categories within STN
