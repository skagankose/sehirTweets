# Analyzing Tweets within Sehir University

### Temporary README.md

Increasing use of social networks created possibilities for analyzing societies using different techniques. 
In this study, we analyzed the tweets belonging to members of Sehir University. 
First, we extracted four popular topics using LDA.
We consider these topics as four distinct tags, then, we assign a tag to each tweet within the network.
According to tagged tweets, we found a topic distribution for each user. 
To test whether our model is coherent, we collect tweets belonging to four different categories together.
Then, used them to train an LSTM network to generate text for testing. 
Finally, we represent users with Sehir Twitter network (STN) according to four different categories. 
We determined distribution of topics within STN.
